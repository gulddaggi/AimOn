It takes time to talk about that. For us, it's been a constant work in progress, and we knew when we formed this team that it would be something that is a constant process. We focus on the small wins, as long as we keep moving forward.”"}

{"title": "kaajak spearheads retooled FNATIC to Masters Toronto", "context": "That grand finals performance from FNATIC, where they swept Heretics once again, was spearheaded byan absurd performance from kaajak.

{"title": "kaajak spearheads retooled FNATIC to Masters Toronto", "context": "Overconfidence is a genuine worry for kaajak, since he knows what it's like to underperform when it matters most. When he was helping carry Apeks to the Ascension grand finals in 2024,his grand finals performanceleft a lot to be desired. If the series hadn't gone to the map five of Ascent, where he redeemed his previous four maps to win Ascension, he might've remained as an ‘onliner'; a young talent who can only win from the comfort of their home setup instead of the stage."}
{"title": "kaajak spearheads retooled FNATIC to Masters Toronto", "context": "“That Ascension final, that helped me a lot, because I knew it was just a starting point for me,” kaajak said. “Thinking back, I was playing on hard mode. From that final, I learned more about controlling my energy on stage, to be consistent throughout the whole series, instead of using it all too early. Plus, the more time you play on stage, the more you get used to it.”"}
{"title": "kaajak spearheads retooled FNATIC to Masters Toronto", "context": "With his game against Heretics in the VCT EMEA 2025 Stage 1 grand finals, it's fair to say that kaajak is not an onliner. That performance resembled a player who steps up and performs better in a LAN environment. After working with performance coaches on both Apeks and FNATIC, he improved his mental state when under pressure, which mattered the most on stage."}
{"title": "kaajak spearheads retooled FNATIC to Masters Toronto", "context": "Plus, it didn't hurt to have one of the most tenured in-game leaders in the world sitting beside him. Even after coaching changes and a disappointing year in 2024, FNATIC reached the top of EMEA for the umpteenth time thanks to the leadership ofBoaster."}
{"title": "kaajak spearheads retooled FNATIC to Masters Toronto", "context": "“I think [Boaster] is very smart in-game, but he's also one of the hardest-working people I know,” kaajak said. “He's always VOD reviewing, practicing, and testing new ideas frequently on the servers. When your IGL is doing that, that inspires confidence in the team.”"}
{"title": "kaajak spearheads retooled FNATIC to Masters Toronto", "context": "While kaajak was a star in the Stage 1 playoffs, Boaster's calls were immaculate, especially on Split.

Fnatic rallied back six rounds in a row to bring the score to 11-10.

At some point we did it well, but we struggled with actually doing what we need to do after that. We had a lot of times three or more people on sites and we were not really ready to counter them, and that was our problem. But I think it's something about related to the fact that we played Abyss only once and it might be good, might be great, or might be super bad. Today it wasn't great obviously, we lost, but I think it's a good lesson for us and I think we will come back better with Abyss or maybe some other maps in the next match.\""}

Also, it's just a disaster at this point because they have an Operator. What's better for an Operator than when the guys are kind of trolling? Obviously, it's hard to play after that and it's just very tough. We were giving also some entries but I didn't feel it was because of these types of mistakes, but just overall.

{"title": "Chronicle: \"I think we were clueless\"", "context": "\"No, they already played Chamber. They already did all this stuff but they just decided to swap. They put Foxy9 on Chamber and Flashback was playing Viper. This change I think makes sense because I think Foxy9 can utilize Chamber slightly better than Flashback, not to blame someone, it just is how it is. Overall, we actually knew how to play against their Chamber, but on defense, we didn't realize it at first. On attack, we didn't have that much to actually do. I mean, we were punishing him for staying on C which they default stuff on C like with the Chamber but we just, I think after that, we didn't realize our advantages and overall we again didn't play really well together.\""}

Sometimes we are communicating like a tier three team and we are not doing the basic stuff. It's just actually insane. Like, we are communicating so well, we are taking almost every single advantage or situation properly and we are like unstoppable. Today it obviously was a tier three performance for us sadly. We will try to work on it. For me, I would say I tried to communicate as much as possible but in some moments I still had problems with adapting and trying to find a proper solution for our team how to win certain rounds. I think I need to work on that, of course, but overall I'm happy with how I called in the situation even if it was bad. That's how I look at it, but obviously I did a lot of mistakes too.\""}

I think that his mentality is extremely strong, and he showed it very well, to will the team on, to say how things are gonna go, and to not accept the way that the games were going.

Alfajer got within milliseconds of defusing the Spike and winning a 1v2, but Less denied him just in the nick of time. FNATIC's buy was shoddy in the next round, but Derke picked up a 3K with a hero rifle to win the round for his team.

I could 100% see on the defense of Icebox that we weren't playing like practice. People weren't comming things that they were seeing, things about the scoreboard, like the ultimates and economy, it just was a mess, to be quite honest. I basically just said, we can still win this game, if you just comm what you see, and look at the ults.”"}
{"title": "Map 5: Icebox", "context": "At this point, the home crowd was looking to will their team to victory, erupting into earth-shattering cheers at every LOUD kill.

{"title": "Map 5: Icebox", "context": "Still, there was a lot to do if they wanted any hope of coming back in this game.

Derke came out on top and prompted a timeout from the Brazilian side."}
{"title": "Map 5: Icebox", "context": "“I think in my mind I had something about that Sentinels game, two years ago,” Derke said. “I didn't perform as well, especially on the last map, and TenZ was in form then too.

Mostly the breathing thing helped with the stress.”"}
{"title": "Map 5: Icebox", "context": "After a quick anti-eco, FNATIC found another round by planting under the nose of Less in his Viper's Pit and winning in the post-plant.

The prospect of a comeback was now dawning in the minds of seven thousand Brazilian fans watching from the stands."}
{"title": "Map 5: Icebox", "context": "LOUD injected some life into their game and made FNATIC sweat on the following eco round, pressuring Boaster to invest his Viper's Pit to win the round.

Nevertheless, FNATIC won the gun duels and set the score all level at 11-11."}
{"title": "Map 5: Icebox", "context": "LOUD looked poised to finally break the streak when they got FNATIC to their knees on an eco round.

{"title": "Map 5: Icebox", "context": "In the final round of the game, Chronicle's 3K set up a flawless round to complete an extraordinary comeback and win Icebox 14-12.

{"title": "Map 5: Icebox", "context": "“It feels amazing,” Boaster said. “I just remember at 11-3, during the pause, I was looking at the audience on the top row, and there was like red lights, and they were throwing their boomwhackers, doing all their chants and stuff, and I remember thinking: this is sick. We might've been 11-3 down at that time but I was like, this is kinda unreal. Even if we lose, I'm still really happy and really appreciative to be here in this situation.”"}
{"title": "Map 5: Icebox", "context": "“We didn't necessarily know what to expect when we came into this tournament, what kind of results we'd have,” fRoD said. “We had just been working really hard and focusing on our practice, our training, and just growing as a team and a little family. For us, I think that these growing pains from the victories we had and the loss we had in the grand finals will be something that we can carry for the rest of our lives, not just for this year.”"}
{"title": "Map 5: Icebox", "context": "FNATIC's triumphant start to the season means they have secured their region a fourth slot at the next Masters event in Tokyo. For LOUD, who came so painstakingly close to achieving the same thing, Boaster had some encouraging words."}

Keep working, keep improving, every day is a day where you can improve. Not just in Valorant, but in maybe your mental, or how you treat others. We're very lucky to be in this scenario where we can compete on stage. That's what I said to my boys, look how many people have come to watch five virgins sitting on stage playing a video game, that's a big achievement.

{"title": "Semifinal #2:Fnatic vs. Gambit Esports", "context": "Likewise, Fnatic had every intention of showing their prowess against their opponents, and did so with a strong start on Icebox. They took the first eight rounds of the attacking side, with multiple flanks fromMartin\t\t\"MAGNUM\"\n\t\tPenkovallowing Fnatic the map control and numbers advantage to put otherwise evenly matched rounds in Fnatic's control. This trend of flanks from Fnatic members dealing costly blows to Gambit members continued throughout the rest of the map, and eventually brought the final score of Icebox to 13-6, with Fnatic only needing one more map to clinch a spot in the Grand Finals and in Iceland."}

Following the oppressive first half by Gambit, Fnatic struck back with six straight round wins to nearly even out the map score.

Jamppi made attempts to crack open the Fnatic defense on multiple occasions with the Operator, but found very little success in the rounds that he did purchase the 5,000 credit sniper rifle. Oddly enough, Liquid chose to build their team composition without any duelists, despite teams lately leaning towards team compositions with only a single duelist and more utility from controllers and initiators to use for the team, unlike previous patches.

Liquid, on the other hand, chose a single duelist composition with Sage as their sole sentinel, and two controllers in the forms of Brimstone and Viper. Liquid started their attack on Split in a dominating fashion, securing 9 rounds in the first half, putting them in prime position to clinch the series on the notoriously defender-favored map. But it was only in round 17, after losing the first four rounds of the second half, that Liquid would start to gain momentum in the match.
